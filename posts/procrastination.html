      <h5 class='date'>Date - 14th Jan, 2018</h5>
      <p> While going through a pile of junk on my desk, I found this piece of paper,
        where I had joted down some pointers on why people procrastinate, while preparing
        for an event for a public speaking group that I used to attend in the latter half of 2016. </p>

      <p>It goes without saying that I have been putting off cleaning my desk for too long now,
        so would make a good entry to the start of the 2018 article writing phase.</p>


      <p>Here goes:</p>

      <p>So why do people procrastinate? </p>

      <p>Basically, we procrastinate about things that make us uncomfortable. We think about things we don't particularly like and the pain center in our brains light up. So we shift out attention to something more enjoyable, which causes us to feel better,
      atleast temporarily. This avoidance of pain is partly due to the fact that evolution has ingrained in us the importance of running away from anything that causes us pain or when the brain senses any incoming danger. The survival of our ancestors depended on them heeding to those cues and made sense then. But in the modern age where we don't have to fight off saber tooth tigers anymore, it has become a drain on human productivity. When we are forced to do things against our will, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the pain centers in our brains light up, the brain senses danger and we try to withdraw from the pain triggering event. This is followed by us picking something that's less painful, something the brain associates as being pleasurable. Hence the endless scrolling through the internet, when the sensible part of our brain says we need to work on the assignment that we have been put off for weeks. This avoids the painful, albeit important task at hand which if we are to stick to will bring more pleasure in the long run. But the short term dopomine(pleasure hormone) hits are just too powerful to ignore and they win the battle. In the long run these routine habitual response becomes so powerful that they almost become second nature to us as soon as we encounter that special cue and that traits trumps everything else. These responses are focussed on making the here and now better.</p>

      <p>Procrastination can be a single most important key stone bad habit - a habit that has the potential to influence many areas of our lives. Procrastination shares feature with addiction - it offers temporary relief and excitement from something boring in reality. We device irrational excuses that sounds superficially reasonable, like if I start early I will forget the material by the time of the test. Procrastinators put off that little bit of work, they do it again and again but gradually grow used to it. They look healthy but the long term effects are not so good.</p>

      <p>One handy tool to stop procastinatinating is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodero techique</a> - 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus, followed by a bit of relaxation. Another helpful technique is to break down big task into small managable tasks, that don't seem too daunting at first sight. Tackling the smaller problems is much easier and much more fictionless to start than a task that looks massive on paper. Also understanding a bit about cognitive psychology of procastinators might help mitigate the problem.</p>
